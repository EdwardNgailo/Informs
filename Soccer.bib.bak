Using NHL regular-season data from 2005–2010, we identify four forward types, four defensemen types, and three goalie types. Goalies tend to contribute the most to team performance, followed by forwards and then defensemen. We also show that once we account for salary cap and playing-time information, the value of different player types may become similar. Lastly, we illustrate how to use the regression results to analyze trades and their impact on team performance. },

  abstract  = {Abstract
1. Despite large investments of public funds into environmental flows programs, we
have little ability to make quantitative predictions of the ecological benefits of
restored flow regimes. Rather, ecological predictions in environmental flow
assessments typically have been qualitative and based largely upon expert opinion. Widely applicable, quantitative models would help to justify existing flow
programs and to inform future planning.
2. Here, we used a hierarchical Bayesian analysis of monitoring data coupled with
expert-derived prior distributions, to develop such a model. We quantified the
relationship between the duration and frequency of inundation, and encroachment of terrestrial vegetation into regulated river channels. The analysis was
informed by data from 27 sites on seven rivers.
3. We found that longer inundation durations reduce terrestrial vegetation
encroachment. For example, a 50-day continuous inundation during winter
reduced predicted vegetation cover to a median of 11% (95% CI: 7%–35%) of
cover predicted under non-inundated conditions. This effect varied among sites
and rivers, and was moderated by the frequency of inundation events.
4. The hierarchical structure improved precision of model predictions relative to
simpler analysis structures. Informative prior distributions also improved precision
relative to minimally informative priors.
5. The hierarchical Bayesian analysis allows us to make quantitative predictions of
ecological response under the full range of flow conditions, allowing us to assess
the benefits of planned or delivered environmental flows. It can be used to make
estimates of ecological effects at sites that have not been sampled, and also to
scale up site-level results to catchment and regional scales. Quantitative predictions of ecological effects provide a more objective risk-based approach, allowing
improved planning of environmental flows and building public confidence in
these major investments of public funds.

  abstract = { The difference in difference (DID) design is a quasi-experimental research design that researchers often use to study causal relationships in public health settings where randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are infeasible or unethical. However, causal inference poses many challenges in DID designs. In this article, we review key features of DID designs with an emphasis on public health policy research. Contemporary researchers should take an active approach to the design of DID studies, seeking to construct comparison groups, sensitivity analyses, and robustness checks that help validate the method’s assumptions. We explain the key assumptions of the design and discuss analytic tactics, supplementary analysis, and approaches to statistical inference that are often important in applied research. The DID design is not a perfect substitute for randomized experiments, but it often represents a feasible way to learn about casual relationships. We conclude by noting that combining elements from multiple quasi-experimental techniques may be important in the next wave of innovations to the DID approach.
